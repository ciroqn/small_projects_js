/*This project creates a randomly generated three-course menu with total price attached. The mechanism is an object which has three courses (arrays within objects)
and several functions (methods) which add dishes and prices to certain courses (i.e. appetisers, mains, desserts), and generates a three-course menu based on a 
random index. It also has getter and setter methods. */
